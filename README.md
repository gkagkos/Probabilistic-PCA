Implementation of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis.\
About: An implementation of PPCA by following the paper of Michael E. Tipping and Christopher M. Bishop.\
Dataset_Generator.py : Generate random Dataset, CIFAR10, MNIST.  
Utils.py : Contain functions that are used for the pre-proccessing of data.\
PPCA.py : Implementation of PPCA with expectation maximazations. Also some tries on Maximum Likelihood but still incomplete. \
Main.py : Main file that runs the code.
KernelPCA.py : Implementation of Kernel PCA (incomplete).
